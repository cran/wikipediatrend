\title{Function for getting access statistics for wikipedia pages}
\usage{
wp_trend(page = "Peter_principle", from = Sys.Date() - 30,
  to = Sys.Date(), lang = "en", friendly = F, requestFrom = "anonymous",
  userAgent = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{page}{The name of the Wikipedia page as to be found in the URL to the
  wikipedia article. If e.g. the URL is:
  \code{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fox_(musician)}, than the page
  name equals to \code{Peter_Fox_(musician)}.}

\item{from}{The starting date of the timespan for which access statistics
  should be retrieved - note that there is no data prior to 2007-12-01.
  Supply some sort of timestamp e.g. of class POSIXlt, POSIXct, Date, or
  character. If the option is of type character it should be in the form of
  yyyy-mm-dd.}

\item{to}{The last date for which access statistics should be retrieved.
  Supply some sort of timestamp e.g. of class POSIXlt, POSIXct, Date, or
  character. If the option is of type character it should be in the form of
  yyyy-mm-dd.}

\item{lang}{The language shorthand identifying which Wikipedia access
  statistics are to be used: e.g. \code{"en"} for the English version found
  at http://en.wikipedia.org, \code{"de"} for the German version found at
  http://de.wikipedia.org or perhaps \code{"als"} for the Alemannic dialect
  found under http://als.wikipedia.org/.}

\item{friendly}{Either \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}, \code{1} or \code{2} This
  option causes twofold. First, if the value is set to TRUE, 1, or 2 the
  results of the request are saved in the current working directory in a CSV
  file with name scheme: \code{wp__[page name]_[country code].csv}. Second,
  the function will look if perhaps a previously saved result is available to
  be used to only download those information that are still missing instead
  of the whole timespan.

  For storage on disk \code{write.csv()} (friendly=TRUE or friendly=1) and
  \code{write.csv2()} (friendly=2) are used.}

\item{requestFrom}{This parameter sends an identifier (i.e. your email
  address to contact you if necessary) to stats.grok.se (the server that
  kindly provides the information you request).}

\item{userAgent}{Whether or not to send the following information along your
  requests: \code{paste( "wikipediatrend running on: ", R.version$platform,
  R.version$version.string, sep=", ")}}
