\title{Function for getting access statistics for wikipedia pages}
\usage{
wp_trend(page, from = prev_month_start(), to = prev_month_end(),
  lang = "en", file = wp_cache_file(), friendly, requestFrom, userAgent)
}
\arguments{
\item{page}{The name of the Wikipedia page as to be found in the URL to the
  wikipedia article. If e.g. the URL is:
  \code{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fox_(musician)}, than the page
  name equals to \code{Peter_Fox_(musician)}.}

\item{from}{The starting date of the timespan for which access statistics
  should be retrieved - note that there is no data prior to 2007-12-01.
  Supply some sort of timestamp e.g. of class POSIXlt, POSIXct, Date, or
  character. If the option is of type character it should be in the form of
  yyyy-mm-dd.}

\item{to}{The last date for which access statistics should be retrieved.
  Supply some sort of timestamp e.g. of class POSIXlt, POSIXct, Date, or
  character. If the option is of type character it should be in the form of
  yyyy-mm-dd.}

\item{lang}{The language shorthand identifying which Wikipedia access
  statistics are to be used: e.g. \code{"en"} for the English version found
  at http://en.wikipedia.org, \code{"de"} for the German version found at
  http://de.wikipedia.org or perhaps \code{"als"} for the Alemannic dialect
  found under http://als.wikipedia.org/.}

\item{file}{Where to cache/store the retrieved data? By default a file within
  the user folder is used for as long as the R session takes place. The data
  is stored in CSV format. If an already existing file is used for storage,
  the old data will not be deleted but instead new data will be added to this
  file.

  path to your current cache file:\cr
  \code{wp_cache_file()}\cr
  \code{dirname(wp_cache_file())}


  browse to the folder containing you current cache file:\cr
  \code{browseURL(wp_cache_file())}}
